# hello-world
My First Project
I am beginning my journey today to become a master level programmer! It won't be hard it will just take deligence, patience, and practice and I won't ever give up.
Follow my journey from complete novice to a master of programming, math, and artificial intelligence.
I'll be documenting my progress, so be sure to follow along. You will not regret it!
